Tech Stack
​HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools
​Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics 4, Google Ads (design only — no live account exists for this exercise)
​How to Run
​Task 2 (The Landing Page)
​Open task-2/index.html directly in any standard web browser. No server or build steps required.
​To check the dataLayer push live:
​Open the browser console (F12 -> Console tab).
​Fill in the form fields and click submit.
​Run window.dataLayer in the console — the consultation_form_submitted event should be logged as the last entry.
​Task 1 & Task 3
​Both deliverables are written as clear Markdown files and can be read directly on GitHub under their respective folders.
​Remaining Before Final Submission
​[x] Confirm consultation_form_submitted fires in window.dataLayer on submit, not on load — verified in browser console
​[x] Local Lighthouse Mobile check — 90+ Mobile Core Web Vitals achieved
​[x] Hosted on GitHub Pages for live preview
​[ ] Record the Loom video (max 8 min): GTM schema decisions (2 min) → live dataLayer demo in console (3 min) → integration architecture answer (3 min)
